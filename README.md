# The Astrolabe Generator
A Java-based tool for generating EPS files for constructing astrolabes and related tools

In support of my ongoing research project into medieval scientific instruments such as the astrolabe, I have created a tool to allow the design of custom astrolabes. 

## Features:

- Allows customization of the astrolabe with a wide variety of options.
- Additional related instruments are available:
  - The Universal Astrolabe.
  - The Sine Quadrant.
  - The Horary Quadrant.
- Java based (executable .jar).
- Generates Encapsulated PostScript (eps) files.
- Saves to zip or folder.
- Prints to PostScript capable printers.
